# Particle Simulation and Entropy Calculation <!-- omit in toc -->

## Overview <!-- omit in toc -->

This project simulates the behavior of particles in a two-dimensional box. The simulation considers various physical properties and interactions, including entropy, temperature, and collisions. The primary goal is to study the evolution of these properties over time.
